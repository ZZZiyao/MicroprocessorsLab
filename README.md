This assembly program for PIC microcontrollers displays a "Hello World!" message and reads analog signals via an ADC, showing the results on an LCD. It utilizes UART for message transmission and debugging, demonstrating basic interfacing and real-time data processing on embedded systems.

Set up procedures of LCD and UART are in LCD.s and UART.s, which can be called in the main program.
