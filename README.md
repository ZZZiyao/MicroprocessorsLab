This PIC microcontroller assembly program interfaces with UART, an LCD display, and a Real-Time Clock and Calendar (RTCC). It initializes these peripherals to transmit a "Hello World!" message via UART, display it on the LCD without the final carriage return, and continuously update and output the current seconds to PORTD from the RTCC.
