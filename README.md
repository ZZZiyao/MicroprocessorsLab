This assembly program generates a triangular waveform by outputting data to PORTD, which is connected to a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). To visualize and verify the waveform's characteristics, connect the DAC output to an oscilloscope, a triangular waveform can be observed, indicating the digital signal input has been converted to analoge output successfully.
