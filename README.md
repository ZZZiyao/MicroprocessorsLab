# Microprocessors
Repository for Physics Year 3 microprocessors lab, collaborated with [my lab partner](https://github.com/jy3122).

A simple assembly program for PIC18 microprocessor, that counts to 100, putting the current count value out onto PORTB.

Programs that integrate with peripherals and other components of PIC18 (LCD, Keypad, LEDs, Timer, Interupts, ADC, DAC...) are written in other branches.

This repository is intended for academic and personal use ONLY.
